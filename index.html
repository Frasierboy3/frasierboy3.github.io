                <strong><small>
                <p> Hello. My name is Chester Frasier, and this section will tell you a little bit about me. I am a 23 year old male that lives in Hood River, Oregon. I am looking forward to learning much more about coding and how to program in different languages, as I have only used python before in the past.  
                </p>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <strong><small></small></strong>
                <p> Some background information about me is that I was born in raised in a small town in Oregon called Hood River, which is about an hour east of Portland and rests along the Columbia River Gorge and at the base of Mt. Hood. I went to college at Oregon State University, where I recieved my Bachelors Degree in Human Development and Family Sciences. I am currently working as a Consultant helping individuals to hire Home Care Workers, but am hoping to make a career change into the programming world. I have a large family, consisting of seven brothers and sisters.

                <strong><small>Why become a developer?</small></strong>
                <p>
                    I want to become a developer as I have been working with and around computers my entire life, and I was recently introduced to the career path by a friend and took an introductory python class and really enjoyed it. I would like to become a developer so that I can put my own touch on different programs, and hopefully learn how to create my own Videogame someday.
